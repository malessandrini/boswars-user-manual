# Introduction

[Bos Wars](https://www.boswars.org/) is a free-software real-time strategy (RTS) game. In an RTS game you usually must conquer the whole "world" in a given level, destroying all the enemies in the process. Generally you start in a small corner with very few resources, and you have to build your army (including defenses for your bases) in order to explore and conquer wider and wider areas and defy the enemies you encounter. In doing so you also have to manage the resources you need (energy, materials) and find ever new supplies of them. But beware, enemies in the dark meanwhile are working fast with the same goal, including destroying you, so you must adopt a good strategy and balance all your resources.
